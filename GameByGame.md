# Game By Game Issues

**Note:**
This is not about situations like "if you go to this place, it will warp you somewhere because of a bug"; that's more of an easter egg if you aren't seriously harmed.
This is not about poor controls, or bad collision detection.

This is about serious issues which will cause something similar to one of the following:
 1. Authors recognizing an error big enough to issue a re-pressing of the game as a correction (need details so that bad games can be identified)
 2. Game includes a Warning message, to inform players not to do something (hopefully we can get details)
 3. Game-halting error
 4. Wipeout of save data

## HuCard

### Jaseikin Necromancer:

Numerous bugs, see here:

### Shiryou Sensen (War of the Dead)

 - If you acquire 15 or more items, bugs appear, so don't exceed 13 items.
 - If you acquire too many experience points (9999), bugs appear, so you may want to get rid
of the sapphire if you exceed 5000 points (the game can be cleared with only 2000 points, BTW).
 - In chapter 8, you should evaluate your inventory ad eliminate any unused items. Apparently,
issues may appear (due to bugs) if these are taken into Chapter 9.

### Youkai Douchuuki

 - Not compatible with multitap adapter; if the multitap ic connected, it appears to be make the machine go dead


## CDROM

### Altered Beast (CD-ROM)

If you run it on a System Card other than version 1.0, then power up twice to get the altered
form, the game will stop progressing at that point.  A "fix" version reportedly exists
(although I have never seen one), but that version is also reported to have bugs.


### Arunama No Kiba:

This website calls it a "storm" of bugs:

### Linda 3:

In Scenario B, the game freezes when Track 28 is used to play background music

### Monster Maker:

A warning card was included in the game, to instruct users not to do certain things, as errors would occur.

(I will follow up with translation and further details)


### Puyo Puyo 2 CD

In a Stage including Time Bonuses, if you collect over 65536 points, the points will overflow, and
there is a bug with the NEXT EXP, which in reality makes it impossible to complete the game
(16,770,000 needed, or something like that).

### Super Darius II

There seems to be a freeze issue in Zone Z ("Hirame" = Flounder), which causes a freeze.

### Tokimeki Memorial:

Multiple pressings due to bugs.

Reference: [http://www.big.or.jp/~tokimeki/lib/pcev.htm](http://www.big.or.jp/~tokimeki/lib/pcev.htm)

(I'll follow up to get this translated soon)


### Tengai Makyou II Manji Maru

Several bugs related to battery backup memory, if the memory is full or nearly full at game start.

Reference: [http://workshop.game.coocan.jp/pceside/sittoku.htm#tengai2bug](http://workshop.game.coocan.jp/pceside/sittoku.htm#tengai2bug)

The article seems to imply that a second pressing went out, but I can't find information on that (or how to identify which is which).
