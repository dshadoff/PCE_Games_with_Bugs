# PCE_Games_with_Bugs

This repository is intended to hold information about games which
have bugs or known issues. Where possible, references to source
information will be cited.

## General Issues

**Note:**
I am not talking about "if you go to this place, it will warp you somewhere because of a bug"; that's more of an easter egg if you aren't seriously harmed.
I'm also not talking about poor controls, or bad collision detection.

I am talking about serious issues which will cause something similar to one of the following:
 1. Authors recognizing an error big enough to issue a re-pressing of the game as a correction (need details so that bad games can be identified)
 2. Game includes a Warning message, to inform players not to do something (hopefully we can get details)
 3. Game-halting error
 4. Wipeout of save data

Individual game information will be found in its own folder on a game-by-game basis.
